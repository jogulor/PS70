  <h4>Tattoo Stencil Machine</h4>

  <div class="hover-text">
    <p>
        I recently got my first tattoo! During a tattoo session, the artist usually must take their client’s inspiration images and test the trace of the image as a tattoo, which can take a long time. Before actually drawing the tattoo, an artist must usually hand draw a stencil and print out a tattoo transfer with a stencil machine. I want to build a machine that can take an inspiration image, turn it into a stencil design digitally, and print it out on tattoo transfer paper.

<h4>Uniqlo-inspired Library Scanning Bin</h4>

<div class="hover-text">
  <p>One task of being a Library Desk Assistant is scanning books in and out. This can be a long, manual process. My mother and I shop at Uniqlo, where you put your clothing in a bin which records the price and item for you to check out. It uses RFID tags to automatically identify what's in the bin. I would love to create something similar but for Lamont Library. I could put books in a bin and scan them all out or in at once.</p>

<h4>Recycling Press</h4>

<div class="hover-text">
  <p>Every week, I take out my trash and recycle. Recycling facilities prefer that items are flattened before they are received. I want to create a low-cost, household press for recycling items or breaking down boxes. I'm am very easily by hydraulic press ASMR, so something similar but for household use would be cool.</p>

</div>
<h4>Smart Navigation Cane</h4>
<div class="hover-text">
<p>Places that are busy — city streets, airport lines, college campuses, concerts — can be difficult to maneuver, and even more difficult for those with visual impairments. I want to build a cane that has navigational capabilities using haptics and audio to help guide people through large built environments.</p>
