<h4>Peering Through the Smoke of Time at Leavitt & Peirce (November 23, 2024)</h4>
<p>Leavitt & Peirce has been selling cologne, chess sets, and the gentleman’s indulgence since 1883. But the original owners of the store engineered it to become a quasi-social club for Harvardians in the late 1800s and early 1900s. And a social club it did become.

<h4>Healey Declares State of Emergency to Take Care of 20,000 Refugees in Mass. (August 18, 2023)</h4>
<p>On the second floor of an orange building on Allston’s Harvard Avenue, the muted conversations of parents and the loud chatter of young children can be heard, among suitcases and toys. In this pocket of the city that is the Brazilian Worker Center, Haitian families seek temporary refuge before continuing their long journeys to hotels or medical centers and pursuing the place where they hope to reside: a safer and more permanent home.</p>
<p>They compose some of the 20,000 individuals, including 5,600 families, living in state shelters in Massachusetts. This is an 80 percent increase from 3,100 families last year, which has left a sustained strain on the state’s housing resources.</p>

<h4>Historical Analysis: The New York Times’s “The Other Busing Program: Mexico Is Pushing Migrants Back South” (December 12, 2024)</h4>
<p>“The buses rumble into town day and night, dumping migrants in a city many didn’t even know existed.” In early May of 2024, New York Times journalists Simon Romero and Paulina Villegas covered the lesser-known deportation event happening along the US-Mexican border: Mexican immigrant officials are busing migrants hoping to reach America even before they cross the border “in a shadowy program meant to appease the Biden administration.” Deportation has existed in America as long as the notion of a border has existed in America. The perception of deportation in America often centers the US government as the sole agent of such campaigns; it is necessary to realize that the Mexican government also has its motivations to keep people from leaving its borders. Romero and Villegas provide a multidimensional reporting of the current state of Mexico’s in-country deportation, as well as the financial, physical, and emotional effects that such deportees face. This is not a new occurrence: the US and Mexico have been accomplices in deportation for decades. Historically, while having different motivations behind deportation the two nations have allied in discrete deportation campaigns at the US-Mexico border, which demonstrate how deportees are caught in the crosshairs of Mexican-US policy relations and as a result, placed under inhumane and violent conditions. American historical events including the repatriation of Mexican-Americans during the 1930s and Operation Wetback in 1954 explain the nature of deportations.</p>

<h4>Oral History: Immigration, not a straight line: Xiong Lin’s journey from Fujian to America in 1996 (December 12, 2024)</h4>
<p>	As is the challenge of an oral narrative, it is easy to form a monolith of the Fujianese immigrant experience from one individual story. Like Lin, many Fujianese immigrants indeed are economic immigrants, but as Statz notes, migration can be attributable to many distinct causes, including “state-building projects, family, community norms, religious hierarchies, transnational networks of obligation and support, local values, global fluctuations of power.” Today, there is another increase in undocumented Chinese immigrants “in search of jobs and freedom from China’s heavy-handed pandemic response,” as stated in an article by NPR reporter Huo Jingnan. Just as migration has been and will continue to be integral to the story of humanity for centuries, narratives of hardship, failure and triumph will always come out of such. Lin’s story is one version of an individual attempting to achieve the “American dream” in a much larger context of American policies, Chinese policies, Chinese regional push factors, family traditions, Chinese policies, American policies, and American sentiment about immigrants. It is one of many stories of the human disposition to seek self-actualization—to make the fullest of one’s potential, despite the greatest obstacles. After all, as the protagonist Santiago thinks in Paulo Coehlo’s The Alchemist, “It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting” (Coehlo 20).</p>
